title: /stoprun Command
description: Administrative command to stop the active run (requires operator)
---

The `/stoprun` command is an administrative command that allows operators to immediately stop the current speedrun session. This is useful for server management and moderation purposes.

## Syntax

```
/stoprun
```

<ParamField path="No parameters" type="void">
  This command takes no parameters
</ParamField>

## Permissions

- **Permission Level**: 2 (Gamemaster/Operator)
- **Can be used by**: Operators and console
- **Operator required**: Yes

<Warning>
  This command requires operator permissions. Only trusted server administrators should have access to this command.
</Warning>

## Behavior

When executed by an operator, the `/stoprun` command:

1. Checks if there's an active run
2. Triggers game over to end the run immediately
3. Sends feedback confirming the run was stopped
4. Does not automatically start a new run

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```minecraft Successful Stop
/stoprun
> [Soul Link] Run stopped.
```

```minecraft No Active Run
/stoprun
> [Soul Link] No active run.
```

```minecraft Insufficient Permissions
/stoprun
> You do not have permission to use this command.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Messages

<ResponseField name="Run manager not initialized" type="error">
  The mod failed to initialize properly.
  
  **Solution**: Restart the server or check logs for initialization errors.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="No active run" type="error">
  There is no currently active run to stop.
  
  **Solution**: This is not an error condition - simply indicates no run is in progress.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="You do not have permission to use this command" type="error">
  The player executing the command does not have operator permissions.
  
  **Solution**: Grant operator status with `/op <player>` or use `/reset` instead (no OP required).
</ResponseField>

## Use Cases

### Server Management
- Emergency stop during server maintenance
- Resolving conflicts or disputes
- Testing and debugging

### Player Reset Alternative
For players without operator permissions, use `/reset` instead, which provides similar functionality without requiring elevated permissions.

## Comparison with /reset
