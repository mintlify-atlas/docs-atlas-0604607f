title: /reset Command
description: Restart the current run without requiring operator permissions
---

The `/reset` command allows players to restart the current speedrun session. This is particularly useful for quick resets during practice runs without needing operator permissions.

## Syntax

```
/reset
```

<ParamField path="No parameters" type="void">
  This command takes no parameters
</ParamField>

## Permissions

- **Permission Level**: 0 (All players)
- **Can be used by**: Players and console
- **Operator required**: No

## Behavior

When executed, the `/reset` command:

1. Checks if there's an active run to reset
2. Triggers game over to end the current run
3. Broadcasts reset message to all players
4. Prepares the server for a new run with `/start`

<Warning>
  This command ends the current run immediately. All progress will be lost. Make sure this is what you want before executing.
</Warning>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```minecraft Successful Reset
/reset
> [Soul Link] Run has been reset.
```

```minecraft No Active Run
/reset
> [Soul Link] No active run to reset.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Messages

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="No active run to reset" type="error">
  There is no currently active run to reset.
  
  **Solution**: Start a new run with `/start` first.
