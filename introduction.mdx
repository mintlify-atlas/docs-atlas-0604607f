## Welcome to Soul Link Speedrun

Soul Link Speedrun transforms multiplayer Minecraft into an intense cooperative challenge where **all players share the same health, hunger, and saturation**. Work together with your team to defeat the Ender Dragon as fast as possible - but remember, if any player dies, the run ends for everyone.

## Why Soul Link Speedrun?

### Shared vitality system
All players are connected through a shared pool of health, hunger, and saturation. When one player takes damage, everyone feels it. When one player eats, everyone's hunger bar refills. This creates a unique cooperative dynamic where every action matters.

### Isolated temporary worlds
Each run generates completely isolated temporary worlds that are automatically cleaned up after completion. No more manual world resets - just click and start fresh every time.

### Precise timer system
Track your speedrun time with a two-phase timer that displays in the action bar, capturing your final time from the moment you start until victory or defeat.

### Server-side only
Players connecting to a server with this mod **do not need to install it on their client**. It works seamlessly with any Fabric server setup, making it easy to run with friends.
