description: Overview of all available game modes and chaos modifiers in Soul Link Speedrun
---

Soul Link Speedrun offers several game modes and chaos modifiers that can be enabled to increase difficulty or change gameplay mechanics. These settings are configured through the `/chaos` command before starting a run.

## Available Game Modes

### Core Modes

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Enabling Game Modes

All game modes are configured through the Chaos Modes GUI:

1. Open the settings GUI with `/chaos`
2. Click on the mode icons to toggle them on/off
3. Click the emerald "Confirm" button to save changes
4. Settings apply on the next run (after `/start`)

<Tip>
You can enable multiple game modes simultaneously for extra chaos! For example, combine Half-Heart Mode with Shared Potions for extreme difficulty.
</Tip>

## Mode Compatibility

### Manhunt Mode Interactions

When **Manhunt Mode** is enabled:
- Runners share Soul Link mechanics (health, hunger, and enabled chaos modes)
- Hunters operate with vanilla mechanics and don't share anything
- Game modes like Shared Potions and Synced Inventory only affect Runners

### Settings Persistence

Settings are saved automatically when confirmed:
- Changes made during an active run are queued and apply on the next run
- Difficulty can be changed immediately (even during a run)
- All other settings require a new run to take effect

<Warning>
Some mode combinations are extremely difficult! Half-Heart Mode combined with any other chaos mode can lead to instant death scenarios.
</Warning>

## Implementation Details

Settings are managed by the `Settings.java` class:
- Settings are stored in `settings.json` in the world folder (Settings.java:12)
- Pending changes are queued if a run is active (Settings.java:158-183)
- The settings GUI shows pending changes instead of active settings (SettingsGui.java:52-69)
