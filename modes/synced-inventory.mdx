title: Synced Inventory Mode
description: Documentation for Synced Inventory mode where all players share a single inventory
---

Synced Inventory Mode creates a shared inventory system where all Soul Link players use the **same inventory**. Any item changes made by one player instantly appear in everyone's inventory, creating unique logistical challenges and opportunities.

## Overview

When Synced Inventory Mode is enabled:
- All players share the same 41 inventory slots (main, hotbar, armor, offhand)
- Changes by one player instantly sync to all other players
- Only one "master" inventory exists - preventing duplication exploits
- In Manhunt mode, only Runners share inventory (Hunters are independent)

<Info>
Inventory size: **41 slots total** = 27 main + 9 hotbar + 4 armor + 1 offhand (SharedInventoryHandler.java:22-24)
</Info>

## How to Enable

1. Run `/chaos` to open the Chaos Modes GUI
2. Click on the **Chest/Copper Chest** icon ("Synced Inventory")
   - **Chest** = Disabled
   - **Copper Chest** = Enabled (dark aqua color)
3. Click the emerald "Confirm" button  
4. Start a new run with `/start`

## Gameplay Impact

### Shared Inventory Slots

All inventory slots are synchronized:

**Main Inventory (36 slots):**
- 9 hotbar slots (bottom row)
- 27 main inventory slots (3 rows above hotbar)

**Equipment (5 slots):**
- 4 armor slots (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
- 1 offhand slot

**Total: 41 slots** shared across all players

### Strategic Opportunities

<Tip>
**Advantages of Shared Inventory:**
- Players can specialize in different tasks (one mines, one fights, one builds)
- No need to transfer items between players
- Shared ender chest effect without needing ender chests
- Efficient resource pooling for speedruns
- One player can organize while others gather
</Tip>

### Challenges and Risks

<Warning>
**Coordination Required:**
- Players can accidentally take items others need
- Inventory management requires constant communication
- One player opening inventory blocks others from organizing
- Armor swapping affects everyone simultaneously
- Dropping items removes them for all players
</Warning>

## Advanced Mechanics

### Master Inventory System

The mod uses a single "master" inventory to prevent duplication (SharedInventoryHandler.java:26-33):

```java
private static final List<ItemStack> master = new ArrayList<>(41);
```

**How it works:**
1. One player modifies their inventory
2. Their inventory is copied to the master
3. Master is applied to all other players
4. All players see the same items instantly

This ensures one source of truth and prevents item duplication exploits.

### Synchronization Process

When any player's inventory changes (SharedInventoryHandler.java:152-199):

1. **Detection**: System detects inventory slot change via mixin
2. **Copy Phase**: Changed player's full inventory copied to master
3. **Apply Phase**: Master inventory applied to all other participating players
4. **Sync Guard**: `isSyncing` flag prevents infinite loops during application

```java
public static void syncFromPlayerToAll(ServerPlayerEntity sourcePlayer) {
    isSyncing = true;
    try {
        copyFromPlayer(sourcePlayer);  // Source → Master
        
        for (ServerPlayerEntity player : server.getPlayerManager().getPlayerList()) {
            if (player != sourcePlayer && shouldParticipate(player)) {
                applyToPlayer(player);  // Master → Others
            }
        }
    } finally {
        isSyncing = false;
    }
}
```

### Late Joiners

When a player joins mid-run (SharedInventoryHandler.java:201-229):
- New player receives a copy of the current master inventory
- They immediately sync with existing players
- No items are duplicated during the sync

## Participation Rules

Not all players share inventory - only those participating in Soul Link (SharedInventoryHandler.java:39-60):

**Included:**
- All players in a standard Soul Link run
- Runners in Manhunt mode

**Excluded:**
- Hunters in Manhunt mode (they have independent inventories)
- Players not in the run
- Spectators

```java
private static boolean shouldParticipate(ServerPlayerEntity player) {
    if (!Settings.getInstance().isSyncedInventory()) return false;
    if (!runManager.isPlayerInRun(player)) return false;
    
    // Exclude hunters in Manhunt
    if (Settings.getInstance().isManhuntMode() 
            && ManhuntManager.getInstance().isHunter(player)) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Strategy Guide

### Resource Management

<Tip>
**Organization Tips:**
1. **Assign roles**: One player manages inventory organization
2. **Hotbar protocol**: Designate which player controls each hotbar slot
3. **Tool ownership**: Assign specific tools to specific players
4. **Communication**: Use voice chat to coordinate item usage
5. **Backup sets**: Keep duplicate tools in different slots
</Tip>

### Division of Labor

**Specialized Roles Work Best:**

**Player 1 - Miner:**
- Focuses on gathering resources
- Wears mining gear (efficiency, fortune)
- Manages pickaxes and shovels

**Player 2 - Fighter:**
- Handles combat encounters
- Equips combat armor and weapons
- Manages food consumption

**Player 3 - Builder:**
- Places blocks and builds structures
- Uses building blocks from shared inventory
- Manages scaffolding and ladders

**Player 4 - Organizer:**
- Sorts items in inventory
- Crafts needed items
- Manages inventory space

### Dangerous Situations

<Warning>
**Avoid These Mistakes:**
- **Armor swapping during combat**: Changes everyone's protection
- **Dropping important items**: Removes them for entire team
- **Inventory clutter**: One player's mess affects everyone
- **Using the last tool**: Breaks workflow for all players
- **Food mismanagement**: Taking all food starves the team
</Warning>

## Combat Implications

### Shared Equipment

When fighting with synced inventory:
- Changing armor affects everyone's defense rating
- Swapping to sword removes tools from others
- Using up durability impacts all players
- Death drops affect the entire shared inventory

**Combat Strategy:**
1. Designate one "fighter" who controls combat gear
2. Others stay in safe locations during fights
3. Coordinate armor changes before engaging
4. Keep backup weapons in multiple slots

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety

The master inventory uses synchronization to prevent race conditions (SharedInventoryHandler.java:66-73):

```java
synchronized (master) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        ItemStack stack = inv.getStack(i);
        master.set(i, stack.isEmpty() ? ItemStack.EMPTY : stack.copy());
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles errors (SharedInventoryHandler.java:101-105, 140-143):
- Individual slot failures don't crash the sync
- Invalid players are skipped
- Removed/dead players are ignored
- Errors are logged but don't stop the system

### Reset Behavior

When a run ends or a new run starts (SharedInventoryHandler.java:65-73):
- Master inventory is cleared (all slots set to EMPTY)
- Sync flag is reset
- Players return to normal inventory mechanics

## Manhunt Mode Interaction

In Manhunt mode:
- **Runners** share inventory with each other
- **Hunters** each have independent inventories
- Hunters can't see or access Runner inventory
- This gives Runners coordination advantage but also coordination burden

<Info>
Hunters are excluded from sync via the `shouldParticipate` check (SharedInventoryHandler.java:55-58).
</Info>

## Known Limitations

**Current Restrictions:**
- Only works in the run world (temporary dimensions)
- Doesn't sync to players outside the run
- Inventory size fixed at 41 slots (can't expand)
- No individual "personal" slots

**Not Synced:**
- Crafting table input slots
- Furnace/chest contents
- Ender chest contents (use for personal storage!)
- Cursor item during GUI interactions

<Tip>
**Use ender chests for personal storage!** Ender chest contents are NOT synced, giving each player a private storage space.
