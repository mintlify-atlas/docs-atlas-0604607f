---

Manhunt Mode transforms Soul Link into a competitive asymmetric game mode where **Runners** try to complete objectives while **Hunters** track and eliminate them using special tracking compasses.

## Overview

Manhunt Mode splits players into two teams:

**Runners:**
- Share Soul Link mechanics (health, hunger, stats)
- Benefit from enabled chaos modes (Shared Potions, etc.)
- Win by completing the run objective (defeating the Ender Dragon)
- Get a 30-second head start at the beginning

**Hunters:**
- Use vanilla Minecraft mechanics (independent health/hunger)
- Receive tracking compasses that point to Runners
- Respawn after death and can continue hunting
- Win by eliminating all Runners

## How to Enable

1. Run `/chaos` to open the Chaos Modes GUI
2. Click on the **Ender Eye/Compass** icon ("Manhunt Mode")
   - **Ender Eye** = Disabled
   - **Compass** = Enabled (dark purple color)
3. Click the emerald "Confirm" button
4. Run `/start` to open the **Runner/Hunter selector GUI**
5. Click player heads to toggle between Runner (green) and Hunter (red)
6. Click the emerald to confirm roles and start the run

<Info>
Manhunt Mode requires at least 1 Runner and 1 Hunter to start. The role selector validates this before allowing the run to begin (SpeedrunnerSelectorGui.java:297-313).
</Info>

## Role Selection

### Selector GUI

The Runner/Hunter selector appears before starting any Manhunt run:

**GUI Layout:**
- Player heads fill the center area (up to 34 players supported)
- Each head shows current role: Runner (green) or Hunter (red)
- Click any head to toggle that player's role
- Emerald at bottom shows role counts and starts the run
- Barrier appears if role requirements aren't met

**Role Display:**
```
Runner | PlayerName    (Green prefix)
Hunter | PlayerName    (Red prefix)
```

### Default Roles

When the selector opens:
- All players default to **Runner** role (SpeedrunnerSelectorGui.java:54-56)
- You must manually assign at least one Hunter
- Roles are announced to all players when confirmed

## Tracking Compasses

### How Tracking Works

Hunters receive special compasses that track Runners:

1. Compasses automatically point to the currently tracked Runner
2. Right-click the compass to cycle between Runners
3. Tracking works across dimensions
4. If the target is in another dimension, compass points to their last known location in your dimension

<Tip>
**Compass Features:**
- Name: "Runner Tracker" (red text)
- Tooltip: "Right Click to swap target"
- Updates every 20 ticks (1 second)
- Automatically given to Hunters at run start
</Tip>

### Cross-Dimension Tracking

The tracking system handles dimension changes intelligently (CompassTrackingHandler.java:166-202):

1. **Same Dimension**: Compass points directly to Runner's current position
2. **Different Dimension**: Compass points to Runner's last known position in your dimension
3. Position history is updated every second for each dimension
4. Switching dimensions lets you follow their trail

**Example:**
- Runner enters the Nether
- Your compass (Overworld) points to where they entered the portal
- You can follow to the same portal location

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Runner Mechanics

Runners function like normal Soul Link mode:
- Shared health and hunger across all Runners
- One Runner dies = all Runners die (game over)
- Benefit from chaos modes (Shared Potions, Synced Inventory, etc.)
- Get 30-second head start before Hunters can move
- Normal respawn rules (respawn at world spawn)

### Hunter Mechanics

Hunters operate independently:
- Vanilla health and hunger (not shared)
- Unlimited respawns at world spawn
- Not affected by chaos modes (Shared Potions, etc.)
- Cannot damage each other (team damage prevention)
- Receive tracking compass automatically

<Info>
Hunters bypass Soul Link mechanics entirely - they're treated as separate from the shared health/stats system (ManhuntManager.java:18, SharedInventoryHandler.java:55-58).
</Info>

### Head Start Timer

The run begins with a 30-second head start for Runners:
- Hunters spawn but cannot move/act immediately
- Timer is displayed on action bar
- Runners can gather resources, find shelter, or travel
- After 30 seconds, Hunters are released and tracking begins

## Teams and Display

### Scoreboard Teams

Manhunt creates colored name tags for identification (ManhuntManager.java:139-168):

**Runner Team:**
- Prefix: **Runner** | (Green, Bold)
- Name color: White
- Team name: `soullink_runners`

**Hunter Team:**
- Prefix: **Hunter** | (Red, Bold)  
- Name color: White
- Team name: `soullink_hunters`

This makes it easy to identify roles from a distance.

### Role Announcements

When roles are confirmed, the system broadcasts (SpeedrunnerSelectorGui.java:339-372):
```
[Soul Link] Runners: Player1, Player2, Player3
[Soul Link] Hunters: Player4, Player5
```

## Strategy Guide

### Runner Strategies

<Tip>
**Survival Tips:**
1. Use the 30-second head start to travel far from spawn
2. Enter the Nether quickly (harder to track in different dimension)
3. Build hidden bases instead of obvious structures
4. Carry Ender Pearls for emergency escapes
5. Split up temporarily to confuse tracking
6. Use water bucket clutches and elytra for mobility
</Tip>

### Hunter Strategies

<Tip>
**Hunting Tips:**
1. Coordinate with other Hunters to surround Runners
2. Track different Runners to cover more ground
3. Guard Nether portals and strongholds
4. Use the tracking compass frequently to anticipate movement
5. Bring respawn anchors to set spawn points in the Nether
6. One Hunter guards the End portal while others pursue
</Tip>

## Advanced Mechanics

### Target Cycling

When right-clicking the compass (CompassTrackingHandler.java:113-164):

1. System gets list of all online Runners
2. Finds current target in the list
3. Cycles to next Runner in order
4. If current target is offline, selects first available Runner
5. Displays "Now tracking: [Name]" message
6. Updates compass lodestone tracking immediately

### Position Tracking

Runner positions are tracked per-dimension (CompassTrackingHandler.java:104-111):
```java
Map<UUID, Map<RegistryKey<World>, GlobalPos>> lastKnownPositions
```

- Each Runner has a map of dimension → last position
- Updated every 20 ticks (1 second)
- Used for cross-dimension tracking
- Cleared when run ends

### Action Bar Suppression

To prevent timer spam from overwriting compass messages (CompassTrackingHandler.java:222-243):
- Compass messages suppress timer display for 3 seconds (60 ticks)
- Hunters see "Now tracking: [Name]" without interruption
- Timer resumes after suppression period expires

## Mode Interactions

### Chaos Modes (Runners Only)

When Manhunt is combined with other modes:

| Mode | Runners | Hunters |
|------|---------|----------|
| Shared Potions | ✅ Share effects | ❌ Independent |
| Synced Inventory | ✅ Share inventory | ❌ Independent |
| Shared Jumping | ✅ Jump together | ❌ Independent |
| Half-Heart | ✅ 0.5 hearts | ❌ Full health |

<Warning>
Runners with Half-Heart Mode enabled are at a severe disadvantage - Hunters have full health while Runners share 0.5 hearts!
</Warning>

## Implementation Details

### Team Management

The `ManhuntManager` class handles role tracking (ManhuntManager.java:18-233):
```java
private final Set<UUID> runners = new HashSet<>();
private final Set<UUID> hunters = new HashSet<>();

public boolean isSpeedrunner(ServerPlayerEntity player) {
    return runners.contains(player.getUuid());
}

public boolean isHunter(ServerPlayerEntity player) {
    return hunters.contains(player.getUuid());
}
```

### Compass Registration

Compass functionality is registered via Fabric API (CompassTrackingHandler.java:47-76):
```java
UseItemCallback.EVENT.register((player, world, hand) -> {
    ItemStack stack = player.getStackInHand(hand);
    if (!stack.isOf(Items.COMPASS)) return ActionResult.PASS;
    
    if (manhunt.isHunter(serverPlayer)) {
        cycleTarget(serverPlayer, server);
        return ActionResult.SUCCESS;
    }
    return ActionResult.PASS;
});
```
