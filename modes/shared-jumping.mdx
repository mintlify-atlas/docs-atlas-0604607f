title: Shared Jumping Mode
description: Documentation for Shared Jumping mode where all players jump simultaneously
---

Shared Jumping Mode synchronizes jumping between all Soul Link players. When one player jumps, all other players are forced to jump at the same time, creating chaotic and unpredictable movement.

## Overview

When Shared Jumping Mode is enabled:
- If any player jumps, all Soul Link players jump simultaneously
- Forced jumps only apply to players on the ground (prevents air-stacking)
- Jump velocity is synchronized across all players
- The system uses tick-end processing to prevent race conditions

## How to Enable

1. Run `/chaos` to open the Chaos Modes GUI
2. Click on the **Feather/Rabbit Foot** icon ("Shared Jumping Mode")
   - **Feather** = Disabled
   - **Rabbit Foot** = Enabled (yellow color)
3. Click the emerald "Confirm" button
4. Start a new run with `/start`

<Info>
The mode displays as "Shared Jumping Mode" with yellow/gold formatting in the GUI (SettingsGui.java:270-296).

## Gameplay Impact

### Movement Challenges

<Warning>
**Coordination Required:**
- Platforming becomes extremely difficult
- One player's jump can cause others to fall
- Bridge building requires perfect synchronization
- Combat movement is unpredictable
- Parkour sections become nearly impossible
</Warning>

### Dangerous Scenarios

**High-Risk Situations:**
- **Cliff edges**: One player jumps, others fall off
- **Lava lakes**: Forced jump while crossing narrow paths
- **The Nether**: Jumping near ledges can be fatal
- **Combat**: Unexpected jumps ruin dodging attempts
- **Elytra flying**: Firework jumping affects all players

### Strategic Opportunities

<Tip>
**Team Strategies:**
- Coordinate jumps in voice chat before attempting
- One player "pilots" while others follow instructions
- Use water buckets more liberally for safety
- Build wider bridges and platforms
- Practice synchronized parkour before difficult sections
</Tip>

## Advanced Mechanics

### Tick-End Processing

The system uses deferred processing to prevent race conditions (SharedJumpHandler.java:92-154):

1. **Jump Detection**: When a player jumps naturally, they're added to `jumpersThisTick` set
2. **Collection Phase**: All jumps during the tick are collected
3. **Processing Phase**: At tick end, forced jumps are applied to non-jumping players
4. **Cleanup**: Tracking sets are cleared for the next tick

This prevents issues where multiple players jumping in the same tick could cause double velocity.

### Ground Detection

Forced jumps are only applied if the player is on the ground (SharedJumpHandler.java:160-163):
```java
// Only apply if player is on the ground (prevent air stacking)
if (!player.isOnGround()) {
    return;
}
```

This prevents players from gaining infinite upward velocity by jumping repeatedly in mid-air.

### Velocity Synchronization

The forced jump applies the same mechanics as a natural jump (SharedJumpHandler.java:166-173):
- Invokes `player.jump()` for vanilla jump behavior
- Triggers exhaustion, statistics, and jump sounds
- Sends velocity packet to client for smooth synchronization

## Implementation Details

### Code Reference

Jump tracking system (SharedJumpHandler.java:21-86):
```java
// Track players who jumped naturally in the current tick
private static final Set<UUID> jumpersThisTick = new HashSet<>();

// Track players who have been forced to jump this tick
private static final Set<UUID> forcedJumpersThisTick = new HashSet<>();

public static void onPlayerJump(ServerPlayerEntity player) {
    // Add to jumpers set and defer processing
    jumpersThisTick.add(player.getUuid());
}
```

Tick-end processing (SharedJumpHandler.java:92-154):
```java
public static void processJumpsAtTickEnd(MinecraftServer server) {
    // Force all non-jumping players to jump
    for (ServerPlayerEntity player : server.getPlayerManager().getPlayerList()) {
        if (jumpersThisTick.contains(player.getUuid())) continue;
        if (forcedJumpersThisTick.contains(player.getUuid())) continue;
        
        applyForceJump(player);
        forcedJumpersThisTick.add(player.getUuid());
    }
}
```

### State Management

The handler tracks several tick counters (SharedJumpHandler.java:29-33):
- `lastCollectedTick`: Last tick where jumps were collected
- `lastProcessedTick`: Last tick where jumps were processed
- `processingJumps`: Flag to prevent recursive processing

This ensures jumps are only processed once per tick and prevents clearing tracking data prematurely.

## Strategy Guide

### Safe Exploration

<Tip>
**Movement Best Practices:**
1. Walk instead of sprint-jumping when possible
2. Build guard rails along all bridges and platforms
3. Use crouch-walking near ledges (prevents forced jumps from moving you)
4. Keep water buckets in hotbar at all times
5. One player should stay stationary while others move
</Tip>

### Building Adaptations

**Modify your building strategy:**
- Make bridges 3+ blocks wide instead of 1-2
- Build walls along the sides of bridges
- Create safety platforms below dangerous areas
- Use scaffolding for vertical movement (more forgiving)
- Avoid parkour-style gaps between platforms

### Combat Tactics

**Fighting with Shared Jumping:**
- Use shields and blocking instead of dodging
- Fight in enclosed spaces (prevents fall damage)
- Coordinate who engages mobs
- One player kites while others shoot from safety
- Avoid cliff-edge combat entirely

## Manhunt Mode Interaction

When combined with Manhunt Mode:
- Only **Runners** share jump mechanics
- Hunters jump independently with vanilla mechanics
- Hunters can exploit this to force Runners into dangerous situations
- Runners must coordinate even more carefully

## Known Issues

The shared jumping system handles several edge cases (SharedJumpHandler.java:65-75):
- Clears tracking sets between ticks only after processing completes
- Prevents double-counting if called during processing
- Handles tick advancement edge cases gracefully

<Info>
If you experience issues with double jumps or missed jumps, check the server logs for debug messages (SharedJumpHandler.java:84-86, 140-143).
