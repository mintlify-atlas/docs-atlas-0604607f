---

Half-Heart Mode (also called "Half Hearted Mode" in the GUI) is an extreme difficulty modifier that caps all players' maximum health to **1 health point (0.5 hearts)**. Any damage is instantly fatal.

## Overview

<Warning>
This is the most dangerous game mode! Any source of damage will instantly kill all Soul Link players. Use extreme caution.
</Warning>

When Half-Heart Mode is enabled:
- All players' maximum health is set to **1.0 HP** (0.5 hearts)
- Any damage source instantly kills the player
- Since health is shared in Soul Link, one death kills everyone
- Healing items and effects have minimal impact

## How to Enable

1. Run `/chaos` to open the Chaos Modes GUI
2. Click on the **Apple/Golden Apple** icon ("Half Hearted Mode")
   - **Apple** = Disabled
   - **Golden Apple** = Enabled
3. Click the emerald "Confirm" button
4. Start a new run with `/start`

<Info>
The setting displays as "Half Hearted Mode" in the GUI with a Light Purple color (SettingsGui.java:205-206).
</Info>

## Gameplay Impact

### Instant Death Scenarios

With only 0.5 hearts, the following are instantly fatal:
- Any mob attack (even baby zombies)
- Fall damage from any height over 1 block
- Environmental damage (fire, lava, drowning)
- Poison and Wither effects
- Explosion damage
- Thorns enchantment
- Contact damage (cacti, sweet berry bushes)

### Strategy Tips

<Tip>
**Recommended Strategies:**
- Avoid ALL combat - use shields and blocking
- Never sprint-jump (fall damage risk)
- Stay away from cliffs and ledges  
- Use water buckets for any descent
- Avoid the Nether entirely (too many hazards)
- One player should scout ahead while others wait in safety
</Tip>

### Dangerous Combinations

Half-Heart Mode becomes nearly impossible when combined with:
- **Shared Potions**: Poison/Wither from one player kills everyone
- **Manhunt Mode**: Hunters have a massive advantage
- **Hard Difficulty**: More mob damage and spawn rates

## Implementation Details

The Half-Heart Mode setting is managed by:
- Setting flag: `Settings.isHalfHeartMode()` (Settings.java:58-64)
- GUI toggle: Slot 12 in Chaos GUI (SettingsGui.java:37)
- Icon: Apple (disabled) / Golden Apple (enabled)
- Tooltip: "Players have only 1 health point!" (SettingsGui.java:222-224)

### Code Reference

The half-heart health cap is applied when the setting is enabled:
```java
// Settings.java:18
private boolean halfHeartMode = false;

// Settings.java:58-64
public boolean isHalfHeartMode() {
    return halfHeartMode;
}

public void setHalfHeartMode(boolean halfHeartMode) {
    this.halfHeartMode = halfHeartMode;
}
```

The GUI displays the current state (SettingsGui.java:202-231):
- Enabled: Golden Apple with green "ENABLED" status
- Disabled: Apple with red "DISABLED" status

<Warning>
**For Speedrunners:** This mode is only recommended for experienced players who have mastered Soul Link mechanics. First-time attempts rarely succeed.
