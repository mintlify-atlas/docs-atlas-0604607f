description: Understanding Soul Link Speedrun compatibility with other Fabric mods and potential conflicts
---

Soul Link Speedrun is designed to be compatible with most Fabric mods, but certain categories of mods may cause conflicts due to the nature of the mod's mechanics.

## Requirements

### Fabric Loader

**Minimum version**: 0.18.4

The mod requires Fabric Loader version 0.18.4 or higher. This version is specified in the mod's dependencies.

### Fabric API

**Required version**: 0.141.1+1.21.11

Fabric API is required for Soul Link Speedrun to function. The mod uses several Fabric API modules including:

- Lifecycle Events
- Networking API
- Command API
- Entity Events

<Note>
  While the mod is developed against Fabric API version `0.141.1+1.21.11`, it should work with other Fabric API versions compatible with Minecraft 1.21.11.
</Note>

### Bundled Dependencies

**Fantasy**: `0.7.0+1.21.11`

The [Fantasy library](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/fantasy) by NucleoidMC is bundled within the mod JAR. This library provides runtime world generation capabilities.

<Note>
  You do NOT need to install Fantasy separately - it's included in the Soul Link Speedrun JAR file.
</Note>

## Known Compatibility Issues

Soul Link Speedrun modifies core game mechanics, which may conflict with other mods that touch similar systems.

### Health & Hunger Modifiers

<Warning>
  Mods that modify health, hunger, or saturation mechanics may conflict with Soul Link's shared vitality system.
</Warning>

Potential conflicts:
- Mods that change max health
- Mods that add custom hunger/saturation mechanics
- Mods that override damage calculations
- Mods that modify food consumption

**Examples**: AppleSkin (usually compatible), Hunger Overhaul variants, Health mods

### Portal & Dimension Mods

<Warning>
  Mods that modify portal behavior or dimension handling may interfere with Soul Link's world generation system.
</Warning>

Soul Link uses Fantasy to create isolated temporary dimensions for each speedrun. Mods that:
- Add custom portals
- Modify Nether/End portal behavior
- Change dimension loading/unloading
- Add new dimensions

**Note**: Most dimension mods work fine, but those that override vanilla portal mechanics may cause issues.

### World Generation Mods

<Warning>
  World generation mods may cause unexpected behavior in Soul Link's temporary worlds.
</Warning>

While generally compatible, mods that significantly alter world generation may:
- Change the difficulty of speedruns
- Affect structure spawning (strongholds, End portals)
- Impact performance during world creation

**Examples**: Terralith, Biomes O' Plenty, BetterEnd, BetterNether

<Note>
  These mods usually work but may make speedruns easier or harder depending on generation changes.
</Note>

### Death Handling Mods

<Warning>
  Mods that prevent death or modify death behavior will conflict with Soul Link's "one death, all dead" mechanic.
</Warning>

Avoid mods that:
- Prevent player death
- Add respawn mechanics
- Modify death penalties
- Override death events

**Examples**: Death chest mods (usually fine), Gravestone mods (usually fine), Totem mods (may work)

## Compatible Mod Categories

The following types of mods are generally safe to use:

### Performance Mods
- Sodium
- Lithium
- Phosphor
- FerriteCore

### Utility Mods
- Mod Menu
- REI (Roughly Enough Items)
- JEI (Just Enough Items)

## Server vs Client

<Note>
  Soul Link Speedrun is a **server-side mod**. Players connecting to a server do NOT need to install it on their client.
</Note>

The mod works seamlessly with:
- Vanilla clients
- Clients with client-side mods only
- Clients with Fabric Loader but no server-side mods

## Testing Compatibility

If you're unsure about a mod's compatibility:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test in a development environment">
    Install both mods in a test environment before deploying to production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for conflicts">
    Look for:
    - Error messages in logs
    - Unexpected behavior with shared health/hunger
    - World generation issues
    - Portal or dimension problems
  </Step>

  <Step title="Report issues">
    If you discover a compatibility issue, report it on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/palicz/Soul-Link-Speedrun/issues) page with:
    - Both mod names and versions
    - Fabric Loader and API versions
    - Description of the conflict
    - Logs if available
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dependency Resolution

The mod uses the Nucleoid Maven repository for the Fantasy dependency:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "Nucleoid"
        url = "https://maven.nucleoid.xyz/"
    }
}
```

If you're developing with Soul Link as a dependency, add this repository to your `build.gradle`.
