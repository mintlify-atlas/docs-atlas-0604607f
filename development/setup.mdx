description: Set up your development environment to contribute to Soul Link Speedrun
---

This guide walks you through setting up a development environment for Soul Link Speedrun mod development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** - Required for compilation
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **An IDE** - IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or Eclipse

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install JDK 21">
    Download and install JDK 21 from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) or your preferred JDK distribution.
    
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    java -version
    ```
    
    Should output Java version 21 or higher.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the Soul Link Speedrun repository from GitHub:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/palicz/Soul-Link-Speedrun.git
    cd Soul-Link-Speedrun
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate IDE files">
    For IntelliJ IDEA:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew genSources
    ```
    
    Then open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA. The IDE will automatically detect it as a Gradle project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify setup">
    Test that everything is configured correctly:
    
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
    
    If successful, you're ready to start developing!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

The project uses the following key technologies:

- **Minecraft Version**: 1.21.11
- **Fabric Loader**: 0.18.4
- **Fabric API**: 0.141.1+1.21.11
- **Yarn Mappings**: 1.21.11+build.3
- **Fabric Loom**: 1.14-SNAPSHOT

## Gradle Configuration

<Note>
  The project is configured to use 1GB of memory for Gradle (`org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1G`).
  
  Configuration cache is disabled due to IntelliJ IDEA compatibility issues.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Once your environment is set up, you can:

- Build the mod JAR file
- Run the mod in a development environment
- Make changes and test them locally

See the [Building](/development/building) guide for information on compiling the mod.
