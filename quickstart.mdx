## Your first speedrun

This guide will walk you through starting and completing your first Soul Link speedrun. The entire process takes just a few minutes!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the server">
    Launch your Fabric server with Soul Link Speedrun installed. Wait for the server to fully start up.
    
    <Note>
      Make sure all players who want to participate are connected to the server before starting the run.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Begin a new run">
    Any player can start a run using the `/start` command:
    
    ```bash
    /start
    ```
    
    The mod will:
    - Generate fresh temporary worlds (Overworld, Nether, and End)
    - Find a suitable spawn point
    - Teleport all players to the spawn location
    - Begin the timer
    
    <Info>
      World generation typically takes 5-15 seconds. Players will be in spectator mode during this process.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Play as a team">
    Once the run starts, you'll see a message: **"World ready! Good luck!"**
    
    All players now:
    - Share the same health pool
    - Share the same hunger and saturation
    - Start in survival mode at the spawn point
    - Can see the run timer in their action bar
    
    <Warning>
      If **any player dies**, the run ends immediately for everyone. Stay safe!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Defeat the Ender Dragon">
    Work together to:
    - Gather resources and craft equipment
    - Find a stronghold and enter the End
    - Defeat the Ender Dragon
    
    When the dragon is defeated, all players will see:
    - A **"VICTORY"** title screen
    - Your final completion time
    - A message with your time in chat
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start a new attempt">
    After a victory or game over, you can immediately start a new run:
    
    - Click the clickable text in chat, or
    - Run `/start` again
    
    The old temporary worlds are automatically deleted and new ones are generated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the basics

### Shared health and hunger

When a run is active:

- **Damage** taken by one player affects all players
- **Healing** (potions, golden apples, natural regeneration) heals everyone
- **Eating** food restores hunger for all players
- **Saturation** is synchronized across the team

### The timer

The timer is displayed in your action bar and tracks:

- **Phase 1**: Time in the Overworld and Nether
- **Phase 2**: Time in the End (starts when the first player enters)
- **Final time**: Total time from start to dragon defeat

### World isolation

Each run creates isolated temporary worlds:

- Fresh terrain generation every time
- Automatic cleanup when the run ends
- No interference with your server's main world

## Essential commands

Here are the commands you'll use most often:

<CodeGroup>
```bash /start
/start
```

```bash /reset
/reset
```

```bash /runinfo
/runinfo
```
</CodeGroup>

| Command | Description | Permission |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/start` | Begin a new speedrun (generates fresh worlds) | All players |
| `/reset` | Instantly restart the current run | All players |
| `/runinfo` | Display current run state, timer, and shared stats | All players |
| `/stoprun` | Stop the current run (admin command) | Operator |

<Tip>
  Use `/runinfo` to check your current health, hunger, game state, and elapsed time at any point during the run.
</Tip>

## Customizing your experience

Soul Link Speedrun includes powerful customization options accessible via the `/chaos` command:

### Settings GUI

Run `/chaos` to open the settings menu where you can toggle:

- **Shared potions**: When enabled, drinking a potion applies the effect to all players (both positive and negative)
- **Shared jumping**: Synchronizes jumps across all players
- **Half-heart mode**: Limits max health to 0.5 hearts for an extreme challenge
- **Difficulty**: Adjust the world difficulty (Peaceful, Easy, Normal, Hard)

<Warning>
  **Half-heart mode** is extremely difficult! One hit from almost any source will end the run.
</Warning>

## Late joiners

Players who join mid-run are automatically handled:

- They are teleported to the spawn point
- Their health, hunger, and stats sync to the shared pool
- A message confirms they've joined and synced

## What happens when you die?

If any player dies during a run:

1. The timer stops immediately
2. All players see a **"GAME OVER"** title with the final time
3. Players are put into spectator mode
4. A clickable message appears to start a new run
5. Temporary worlds remain until a new run starts

## Tips for success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Communication is key">
    Use voice chat or text to coordinate. One player's mistake affects everyone, so stay in constant communication about dangers and resource needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Designate roles">
    Consider splitting tasks:
    - Some players gather food and resources
    - Others focus on finding the stronghold
    - Coordinate who crafts what equipment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Protect the riskiest player">
    If someone is in a dangerous situation (like mining near lava), have others stay safe in case disaster strikes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Share food strategically">
    Remember that eating benefits everyone. Don't waste food when hunger is already high.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Practice makes perfect">
    Your first few runs will likely end quickly. Learn from mistakes and develop strategies as a team.
