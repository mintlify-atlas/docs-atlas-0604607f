</Note>

## Server installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the mod">
    Download Soul Link Speedrun from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/soul-link-speedrun) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/soul-link-speedrun).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Fabric Loader">
    If you haven't already, install Fabric Loader on your server:
    
    1. Download the Fabric installer from [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/)
    2. Run the installer and select your Minecraft version (1.21.11)
    3. Choose your server directory
    
    <Warning>
      Make sure you install Fabric Loader **0.18.4 or higher** as earlier versions are not compatible.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Fabric API">
    Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Minecraft 1.21.11 and place it in your server's `mods` folder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Soul Link Speedrun">
    Place the Soul Link Speedrun JAR file in your server's `mods` folder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start your server">
    Start your Fabric server. You should see Soul Link Speedrun initialize in the console logs:
    
    ```log
    [Server thread/INFO] (Soul Link) Initializing Soul Link Speedrun
    [Server thread/INFO] (Soul Link) Soul Link Speedrun initialized successfully!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Client installation

<Note>
  **Players do not need to install this mod on their client!** Soul Link Speedrun is entirely server-side.

Players can connect to your server with a vanilla Minecraft 1.21.11 client. The mod works seamlessly without requiring any client-side installation.

## Single-player installation

If you want to run Soul Link Speedrun in single-player:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Fabric Loader">
    Download and run the Fabric installer for Minecraft 1.21.11, selecting "Client" installation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Place both **Fabric API** and **Soul Link Speedrun** in your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Minecraft">
    Start Minecraft using the Fabric profile and create a new world or load an existing one.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compatibility notes

### Compatible with

- **Essentials**: Only the server host needs to have it installed
- **Most Fabric mods**: Generally compatible with other server-side mods
- **Modpacks**: Feel free to include this mod in Modrinth/CurseForge modpacks without permission

### Potential conflicts

Soul Link Speedrun may conflict with mods that modify:

- Health and hunger mechanics
- Portal behavior and world generation
- Death handling and respawn logic
- Player synchronization systems

<Warning>
  If you experience issues with other mods, try running Soul Link Speedrun on a clean server with only Fabric API installed to isolate the problem.
</Warning>

## Verify installation

To verify that Soul Link Speedrun is installed correctly:

1. Join your server
2. Run the `/runinfo` command
3. You should see a message showing the current run state

If the command works, you're ready to start your first speedrun!
